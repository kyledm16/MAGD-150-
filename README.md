# Welcome to MAGD 150 Examples

## Example 1

[Stastic Composition](https://github.com/kyledm16/MAGD-150-/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150lab01_Mancheski/s19magd150lab01_Mancheski.pde)

This example shows how to make a black and white composition of a city scene.  This code uses rect() to make the shapes of the buildings, uses ellipse to make the moon in the sky, and lastly uses fill() to change the shade of gray to make the composition more appealing.

## Example 2 

[Color Composition](https://github.com/kyledm16/MAGD-150-/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150lab02_Mancheski/s19magd150lab02_Mancheski.pde)

This example uses color, arcs, ellipses and quads to make a UFO in outer space surrounded by planets

## Example 3 

[Math](https://github.com/kyledm16/MAGD-150-/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150lab03_Mancheski/s19magd150lab03_Mancheski.pde)

This example follows the theme of bubbles by displaying three bubbles.  Two of the bubbles are stationary but the third bubble will follow the mouse around the screen. The code aslo does some math by having the code println with the answers to some math problems. 

## Example 4 

[Organization](https://github.com/kyledm16/MAGD-150-/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab06_Mancheski)

This example uses class to help keep your code organized.  The class *Monster* makes a little purple jellyfish looking monster that moves around the screen slowly and jittery.  At the bottom of the screen the code draws a game controller to have a theme of video games. 

## Example 5 

[Text](https://github.com/kyledm16/MAGD-150-/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150_lab08_Mancheski)

This example makes a movie poster of the made up movie of *The Wonderful Life of Billy Morse* The code has imported text fonts to make the poster more appealing.  On the poster is also a drawing of *Billt Morse* with his nice hat on.  At the bottome of the poster there is text that moves across the screen like during the news.
